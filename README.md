# Image_Caption_Generator_using_Pretrained_Models
This repository contains an implementation of an Image Caption Generator using pretrained models from the Hugging Face model hub. The project aims to automatically generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques.

Key Features:-

Utilizes the state-of-the-art pretrained models from Hugging Face. Seamless integration of computer vision and natural language processing techniques. Generates descriptive captions for a wide range of images. Customizable options for caption generation, such as temperature and beam search parameters. Easy-to-use interface for image captioning, with support for both single image and batch processing.
